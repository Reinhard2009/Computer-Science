        <p>These three characters are one of the most compelling aspects of the film. Their different approaches to the struggle for the independence of the Philippines reflect the deep divisions that existed within the Filipino revolutionary movement and their struggle to have unity. The film does not offer easy answers, but it does provide a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the challenges of leading a revolution.</p>
