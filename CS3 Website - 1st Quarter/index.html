                <h2>Electrical Shock</h2>
                <p>Electrical shock is a serious condition that can occur when a person comes into contact with an electrical current. Electrical shock can cause a variety of injuries, including burns, muscle spasms, cardiac arrest, and even death.</p><p>To prevent electrical shock, it is important to be aware of the electrical hazards in your environment and to take steps to avoid them. Some common electrical hazards include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exposed electrical wires</li>
                    <li>Damaged electrical cords and plugs</li>
                    <li>Wet electrical outlets and appliances</li>
                    <li>Overloaded circuits</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Electrical Fires</h2>
                <p>Electrical fires can occur when electrical wiring or equipment overheats or when there is a short circuit. Electrical fires can be very dangerous and can quickly spread to other parts of your home or business.</p>
                <p>To prevent electrical fires, it is important to have your electrical wiring and equipment inspected and serviced regularly by a qualified electrician. You should also avoid overloading circuits and be careful not to use damaged electrical cords and plugs.</p>

                <h2>Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs)</h2>
                <p>Ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are devices that protect you from electrical shock. GFCIs are required in all wet or damp areas, such as bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms.</p>
                <p>GFCIs work by monitoring the electrical current flowing through a circuit. If there is a difference in current between the hot and neutral wires, the GFCI will trip and shut off the circuit. This helps to prevent electrical shock and electrocution.</p>
                <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Residential_GFCI_receptacle.jpg/800px-Residential_GFCI_receptacle.jpg" width="512" height="512"><img src="https://eaglerock-electricians.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/outlet-gfci-keeps-tripping-eagle-rock-electricians.jpg" width="512" height="512"></p>

                <h2>Arc Flash</h2>
                <p>An arc flash is a sudden release of electrical energy that can cause serious burns, blindness, and even death. Arc flashes can occur when electrical equipment is not properly maintained or when it is misused.</p>
                <p>To prevent arc flash, it is important to have your electrical equipment inspected and serviced regularly by a qualified electrician. You should also be careful when working on electrical equipment and always wear the proper personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
